(The source code for the projects can be found on https://github.com/aakritigupta)
________________
Votekit
A generic RESTful API for creating voting applications, built primarily to soothe the itch of trying Node.js and MongoDB!

Urban Sound Archive
A service for finding and contributing sound content specific to location. This Rails app is a mashup of the Google Maps API and SoundCloud API.
SoundCloud API doesn't yet provide search by location, hence this is a great tool for travellers looking to contribute, collect or explore sounds related to a place or occasion.
I built this in a team of two at the Berlin Geekettes hackday.

Markofy
A web service for marking and highlighting content in articles. Made using Node.js and MongoDB for database.
I built this in a team of two at the DevelopHer hackday.

In-paint
Implemented an in-painting algorithm in MATLAB for a course in Image Processing.

Minotaur
A simple command line based game similar to Pac-man written in C with the aim to explore multithreading and mutexes.


Activities and interests
________________________
I love attending hackathons for the rush of creating something working and useful within 24 hours and with an absolutely new team! I have participated in DevelopHer Hackday organized by LinkedIn and the Berlin Geekettes hackathon.

I am FOSS enthusiast and contribute to KDE when I get time. I attended the Desktop Summit in Berlin, jointly organized by GNOME and KDE and presented my GSoC project.

In college, I served as Joint Secretary and program co-ordinator for WIE group for the IEEE student branch.

When not coding I spend my time reading: On the web, I like Oatmeal comics, Thought Catalogue and Hacker News.

I read a wide variety of books - Ayn Rand, Bernard, Simon Singh are my favourites and I love Shakespeare's plays.
