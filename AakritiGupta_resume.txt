Intern at the Backend Team | 6WunderKinder | January 2013 - April 2013

Intern in the Backend team | SlideShare | May 2012 - July 2012

  - Interned with the core backend team. Investigated open source tools for document format conversion. Coded and tested modules of the current backend infrastructure.

Google Summer of Code Student[8] | May 2011 - August 2011

  - Bringing a prezi-like feature in the presentation application of Calligra[9], the open source office suite built on Qt and KDE[10] libs. The feature lets you make animated SVG presentations which run in all SVG supported web browsers. Javascript from Sozi, is used for animating the elements instead of the traditional animation attributes of SVG, which do not animate quite well.
