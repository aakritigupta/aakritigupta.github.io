  <p>I am an engineer, currently working on the backend at <a href="http://travis-ci.com">Travis CI</a>, a continuous integration platform loved by the open source community.</p>
  <p>Distributed systems and infrastructure topics interest me and that is what I hope to work on in the future.</p>
<p>I love working in small, autonomous teams, with a focus on good software engineering practices. Having experience working and studying remotely, I can work both independently, or while pairing.</p>

    <h2> Industry Experience (2013 - present)</h2>
    <h3> Platform Engineer at <a href="http://travis-ci.com">Travis CI</a> <small><span class="time"> | May 2016 - present</span></small></h3>
    <p>At Travis CI, I build the Travis API and other backend systems in Ruby and Elixir. Most of my work is open source.
Some of my important projects were:
   <ul>
     <li> writing a service in Elixir to merge the commercial and free hosted platforms (ongoing project), tackling data history conflicts, and handling the expected final impact of merging infrastructures,
     <li> improving fair use detection,
     <li> and, building and maintaining several features, e.g. running scheduled builds (crons).
       
  </ul>
    <h3> Backend and Infrastructure Engineer at <a href="http://blacklane.com">Blacklane</a> <small><span class="time"> | December 2014 - April 2016</span></small></h3>
    
    Some of my important projects were:
   <ul>
     <li> migrating the legacy stack to AWS where we used Chef and Terraform to maintain the infrastructure,
     <li> dockerizing some services for development,
     <li> setting up monitoring for the systems, with Stackdriver,
     <li> and, improving and breaking the Ruby monolith into smaller services.
  </ul>
<h3> Backend Engineer at early stage start-ups <small><span class="time"> | May 2013 - November 2014</span></small></h3>
   <p>For a couple of years I worked at early stage start-ups - HowDo and Smart Checkups, where I learnt to take up several responsibilities in a small team. I wrote the Sinatra API at HowDo and worked on the web front-end at SmartCheckups.</p>
   <p> I also worked at a social media marketing analytics consultancy, <a href="http://tdreply.de">TD Reply</a>, with clients like Coca Cola and Volkswagen. I worked on the Ruby backend, responded to outages and worked on provisioning infrastructure with Ansible.</p>

    <h2> Earlier Experience (2012 - 2013)</h2>
    <p> I started out as an engineering graduate, learning from amazing engineers through internships at <a href = "https://www.wunderlist.com/">6WunderKinder</a>, <a href = "http://slideshare.net">SlideShare</a> and also participated in <a href = "http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a>.</p>
